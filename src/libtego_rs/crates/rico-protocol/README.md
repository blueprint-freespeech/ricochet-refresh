# rico-protocol

This crate is a [sans-io](https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/how-to-sans-io.html) pure-Rust implementation of the chat protocol used in [Ricochet-Refresh](https://www.ricochetrefresh.net/). It is integrated into Ricochet-Refresh by way of a separate [tego-rs Rust crate via C-FFI](https://github.com/blueprint-freespeech/ricochet-refresh/tree/main/src/libtego_rs/crates/tego-rs).

## ⚠️ Warning ⚠️

This crate is still under development, though the v3 portion is pretty close to final. Development is underway on the new and improved v4 protocol.
